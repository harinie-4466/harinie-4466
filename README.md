## Hi there 👋 I'm Harinie

I’m a Computer Science undergraduate passionate about building end-to-end full-stack applications.
My work spans AI, ML, data science, and fintech, where I focus on creating intelligent, data-driven solutions to real-world problems.

I believe in learning by building, iterating, and refining — and this GitHub is a reflection of that journey.
